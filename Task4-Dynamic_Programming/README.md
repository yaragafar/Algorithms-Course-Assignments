# sbe307_Task 4 --> Dynamic Programing Problems

- Name: Yara Hossam El-Din
- Sec: 2
- B.N.: 48

## Important Notes

- *A note to be remembered* IDE builds all cpp files then links them together
- Both stress.cpp and test.cpp has its own main function
so remember to do one of the following approaches

1. if you use your IDE blindly *which is totally ok* then comment one of these files then rebuild and run
2. remove one these files form the project, be careful not to delete the file, just remove it from the project then rebuild and run
3. if you control the building process then don't link both files

### Implement this task using c++

In this task you are required to fill 3 files

1. kn_wor.cpp --> implement the solution to knapsack without repetition problem
2. ks_wr.cpp --> implement the solution to knapsack with repetition problem
    - both problems can be found in slides
    - input:
        - line 1: two positive numbers, the number of items (n) and the max weight of the knapsack (w)
        - line 2: n numbers, the weight of each item
        - line 3: n numbers, the value of each item
    - output: a single number, the maximum value
3. lis.cpp --> implement the solution to longest increasing subseuqnce problem
    - description: [leetcode link for the problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/)
    - input:
        - line 1: a positive integer (n) represents the length of the sequence
        - line 2: n numbers, "the sequence to be examined"
    - output: a single number, the longest increasing subsequence

Read the comments carefully and fill the missing lines

### General Notes

- This is an individual based assignment.
- The due date for the submission of this phase is Monday, 13/12/2021 at 11:59 pm.
- Each hour delay will lead to one-point reduction in the homeworkâ€™s grade.
- **Your code should be clear, understandable, and documented (comments). Follow a consistent naming convention for variables and functions and Use clear names for your variables**.
- You are permitted to discuss the following problems with others in the class. However, you must write up your own solutions to these problems. Any indication to the contrary will be considered an act of academic dishonesty. 
- Please review the definition of cheating in the first presentation.
